This repository contains the computational supporting information for the manuscript 'Electronic Structure and CO2 Reactivity of Group IV/V/VI Tetraperoxometalates' submitted to the *Journal of Physical Chemistry A*. Geometry optimizations were carried out in the Gaussian 16 Rev A.03<sup>1</sup> software package with the CAM-B3LYP functional. LAN2LZ was used for the metal center while C and O were modelled with 6-31+G\*. All xyz structures contain the 298.15 K Gibbs free energy in Ha in the comment line. Calculation summaries in each directory were produced using ESIgen<sup>2</sup>.

The reaction [M(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>x-</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> &rarr; [MO(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>x-</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> was modelled for

| Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | Column 3 Header |

| Row 3, Column 1 | Row 3, Column 2 | Row 3, Column 3 |

 (See caption of Scheme 1 for correct M and x combinations). The reaction mechanism sequence for M = is <br> [M(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>x-</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> &rarr; int1 &rarr; ts1 &rarr; int2 &rarr; ts2 &rarr; int3 &rarr; ts3 &rarr; int4 &rarr; ts4 &rarr; int5 &rarr; [MO(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>x-</sup> + O<sub>2</sub>. The step indicated parenthetically is only required for M = .
